attr.tree:
	A <tree-ish> to read gitattributes from instead of the worktree. See
	linkgit:gitattributes[5]. This is equivalent to setting the
	`GIT_ATTR_SOURCE` environment variable, or passing in --attr-source to
	the Git command.

attr.allowInvalidSource::
	If `attr.tree` cannot resolve to a valid tree object, ignore
	`attr.tree` instead of erroring out, and fall back to looking for
	attributes in the default locations. Useful when passing `HEAD` into
	`attr-source` since it allows `HEAD` to point to an unborn branch in
	cases like an empty repository.
